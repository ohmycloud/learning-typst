= Introduction
In this report, we will explore the
various factors that influence fluid
dynamics in glaciers and how they
contribute to the formation and
behavior of these natural structures.

Glacier displacement is influenced by a num-ber of factors, including
1. The climate
2. The topography
3. The geology 

This report will present a physical model of glacier displacement and dynamics, and will explore the influence of these factors on the
movement of large bodies of ice.
